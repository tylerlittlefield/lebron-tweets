# lebron-tweets

<!-- badges: start -->

This repository collects twitter data and stores it to my own personal s3 bucket. More specifically, it... 

* Uses `rtweet` to search for tweets with _"lebron"_ in the text.
* Compares new tweets to tweets that I have already collected by filtering out status IDs that already exist.
* Saves the dataset to a personal s3 bucket.
* Does this daily using a cron job from `cronR`.

I have no real use case for this at the moment. I am more or less just interested in setting up a job to collect data. I think of it as a kind of template that I may come back to if there is any twitter data I'd like to routinely collect.

```{r, example, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(aws.s3)

df <- s3readRDS(
  object = "lebron_tweets.rds",
  bucket = "tylerlittlefield"
)

df %>% 
  distinct(
    created_at,
    text
  )
```
